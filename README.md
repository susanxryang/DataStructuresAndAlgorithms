# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

- hw1: computer programming basics

- hw2: implment DoubleLinkedList, ArrayDictionary, write JUnit tests; create calculator application

- hw4: implement ChainedHashDicitonary, getOrDefault for IDictionary, ChainedHashSet; write Junit tests

- hw5: implement heaps, as well as tf-idf and page rank algorithm;  write Junit tests

- hw7: implement array disjoint set, create maze carving and solving application using Kruskal's algorithm to find MST and to carve the maze, then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path; write Junit tests
